Recordroid is a simple screen recorder created using ScreenRecorderLib from NuGet. 

Features like minimize to tray, custom hotkeys for record/pause and the pause recording button are yet to be functional and are works in progress. The remaining functionalities offered by ScreenRecorderLib have already been implemented, including custom FPS recording, custom audio/video bitrates and custom quality as desired by user.
