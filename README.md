Recordroid is a simple screen recorder created using ScreenRecorderLib from NuGet. 

Features like minimize to tray, custom hotkeys for record/pause and pause buttons are yet to be functional and are work in progress. The remaining functionalities offered by ScreenRecorderLib have already been implemented, including custom FPS recording, custom audio/video bitrates and custom quality as desired by user.
